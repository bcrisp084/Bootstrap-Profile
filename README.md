# Bootstrap-Profile

 Good afternoon and welcome to my Bootstrap project. What i have built here is an entire portfolio/Bio 
 using the Bootstrap framework. Using this tool i have created a 3 page layout that includes previous
 works, an about me page and a contact page with a link to my email and certain social media accounts. 
 I made some extra additions to the page to give it a little more style. I added a background to each
 page to help it stand out and capture the users attention. I also chose to style the links to the social 
 media accounts with colored buttons provided from the Bootstrap framework. The page is simple and direct. 
 You get to learn a little about me and the projects i have worked on so far as well as connecting with me additionaly thru email or social media. The nav bar has 3 tabs that will take you to each of the page's
 content. It was a pleasure to work on this project. I feel as though i have learned alot from it and gained 
 alot of experience in seeing what works well together and what doesn't.
