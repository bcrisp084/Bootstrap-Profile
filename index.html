                <p>My name is Brian Crisp and i am a student at the Johns Hopkins University School of Engineering to
                    become
                    a full stack web developer. I don't have very much experience or knowledge of web page design but
                    that is
                    steadily changing. So far the tools that i have learned in this course have been tremendous in
                    helping me understand and implement them into not only the class projects but also some things that
                    i have always wanted to attempt on my own. I am currently trying to put together a web page for my
                    wife's
                    newly opened dog grooming shop. The Bootstrap framework that was used to create this portfolio has
                    been such a
                    big help in assisting in the design process. Having the ability to copy and paste frame work pieces
                    that someone
                    has created for the benefit of others has started to open my eyes to what the capabilities are and
                    how much faster
                    you can get things done when you don't always have to code from scratch. It is amazing when you look
                    back at
                    these very large files of code and see what they interpret on the user's screen. I never realized
                    how much was
                    involved in the coding process itself and how many different languages there are that don't just
                    work
                    independently from one another but in unison.I currently work as a technician at Mercedes Benz and
                    attend the program in my spare time. I wasn't sure if web development was something that i would
                    just try to dabble with as a side hobby or if it would turn into something that could be my new
                    career moving forward but the more i work on things in and out of the class the more aparent it is
                    becoming
                    to me that this maybe the career i have been looking for my whole life.
